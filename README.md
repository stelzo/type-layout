> [!NOTE]  
> This is only a patched version of the original [type-layout](https://crates.io/crates/type-layout) for using syn 2 instead of syn 1. This crate will be yanked when the original author applied the patch. See the [PR](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/type-layout/pull/9) for progress on this matter.
> The patch contains following changes:
>
> - Use syn v2 as dependency instead of syn v1.0.40.
> - Use memoffset v0.9 instead of v0.5 for fixing a known bug in memoffset where uninitialized memory could be read.
> - Update Rust MSRV to 1.60 (inherited from syn 2).
> - Change Field struct to enum in TypeLayoutInfo from published source to be feature-synced with v0.2.0 on crates.io.
>
> Use this patch like this `type-layout = { version = "0.2", package = "type-layout-syn2" }`.
> While the changes are technically breaking, the original author will decide the actual version.

# type-layout

type-layout is a type layout debugging aid, providing a `#[derive]`able trait
that reports:

- The type's name, size, and minimum alignment
- Each field's name, type, offset, and size
- Padding due to alignment requirements

**type-layout currently only functions on structs with named fields.** This is a
temporary limitation.

### Examples

The layout of types is only defined if they're `#[repr(C)]`. This crate works on
non-`#[repr(C)]` types, but their layout is unpredictable.

```rust
use type_layout::TypeLayout;

#[derive(TypeLayout)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
}

println!("{}", Foo::type_layout());
// prints:
// Foo (size 8, alignment 4)
// | Offset | Name      | Size |
// | ------ | --------- | ---- |
// | 0      | a         | 1    |
// | 1      | [padding] | 3    |
// | 4      | b         | 4    |
```

Over-aligned types have trailing padding, which can be a source of bugs in some
FFI scenarios:

```rust
use type_layout::TypeLayout;

#[derive(TypeLayout)]
#[repr(C, align(128))]
struct OverAligned {
    value: u8,
}

println!("{}", OverAligned::type_layout());
// prints:
// OverAligned (size 128, alignment 128)
// | Offset | Name      | Size |
// | ------ | --------- | ---- |
// | 0      | value     | 1    |
// | 1      | [padding] | 127  |
```

### Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

type-layout supports Rust 1.34.1 and newer. Until type-layout reaches 1.0,
changes to the MSRV will require major version bumps. After 1.0, MSRV changes
will only require minor version bumps, but will need significant justification.
